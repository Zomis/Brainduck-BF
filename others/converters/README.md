All of these tools take as input a text file containing a Brainfuck program,. Your program can have any comments or headers as you see fit. As it is difficult to detect the end of a file from within a Brainfuck program, each of these tools require there to be an at '@' symbol at the end of the Brainfuck code. You should ensure that there are no other occurences of the '@' symbol in your source file otherwise these tools will not be able to correctly handle your Brainfuck programs.
